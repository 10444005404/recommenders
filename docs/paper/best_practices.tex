\section{Best Practices in Recommendation Systems}

The Recommenders repository aims to be a source of best practices in recommendation systems
across several dimensions. First, it is designed to provide guidance on 
which algorithm to use in which circumstance. 
Second, the development team has followed a careful code design process, acquiring 
coding best practices from popular Python repositories like Tensorflow 
\cite{abadi2016tensorflow}, PyTorch \cite{paszke2017automatic} or LightGBM 
\cite{ke2017lightgbm}, and following an {\em evidence-based software design} methodology 
\cite{joeglekar2018evidence}. Third, another objective of the repository
is to serve as a tool for {\em scientific reproducibility}. And finally, we are enabling a 
space of collaboration for the machine learning community to make
contributions in recommendation systems.
We have published the coding 
guidelines\footnote{\url{https://github.com/Microsoft/Recommenders/wiki/Coding-Guidelines}\label{foot_code_guidelines}} 
in the wiki for the repository.
