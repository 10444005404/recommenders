\section{Best Practices in Recommendation Systems}

Recommenders repository aims to be a source of best practices in Recommendation Systems
across several dimensions. First, the repository is designed to provide guidance on algorithm
selection, addressing the problem of which algorithm to use in which circumstance. 
Second, the development team has gone through a careful code design process, acquiring 
coding best practices from popular Python repositories like Tensorflow 
\cite{abadi2016tensorflow}, PyTorch \cite{paszke2017automatic} or LigthGBM 
\cite{ke2017lightgbm}, and following an evidence-based software design methodology 
\cite{joeglekar2018evidence}.
