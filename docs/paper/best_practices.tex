\section{Best Practices in Recommendation Systems}

Best practices of Microsoft Recommenders lie in four folds.
First, it is designed to provide {\em guidance} on 
algorithm selection under a pre-defined business or technical circumstance
Second, code design of the repository adopts best engineering practices from popular libraries like Tensorflow 
\cite{abadi2016tensorflow}, PyTorch \cite{paszke2017automatic} and LightGBM 
\cite{ke2017lightgbm}, supported with an {\em evidence-based software design} methodology 
\cite{joeglekar2018evidence}. Third, the repository
is to serve as a tool for {\em scientific reproducibility} when novel algorithm is designed and tested. And finally, the repository offers {\em space of collaboration} for the machine learning community to make
joint contributions in the recommendation realm.
