\subsection{Collaborative Development Paradigm} %NOT SURE ABOUT THE TITLE

%The majority of the code assets in Microsoft Recommenders are hosted on Github, which offers the advantage that the whole life cycle of its development is transparent to the %open source community. 
The repository is open to collaboration from the broader community, which is supported by 
1) \textit{the unified CI/CD build pipeline and unit/smoke/integration tests} and  
2) \textit{the coding guidelines}. Contributors are required to write unit tests for any notebooks/utilities developed and 
are welcome to participate in code reviews.

%1) \textit{the unified CI/CD build pipeline that runs unit/smoke/integration tests and nightly builds to guarantee quality of code}, 
%2) \textit{coding principles that standardize the conventions applied in the notebook examples as well as the utility functions}. 
%For instance, when contributing a new asset (either an example notebook or a utility function) to the repository, one takes the following steps:
%\begin{enumerate}
%    \item Clone the repository to a local system and set up the development environment.
%    \item Develop notebooks and/or utility functions in a new branch that is based on the ``staging'' branch, push the new code to the remote repository, and create a pull request for merging the code to the "staging" branch.
%    \item Contributors are requested to follow the test-driven design principle so that unit tests for the notebooks/utilities should be developed together with the submitted code. The newly committed code in the pull request is executed through a set of tests in the CI/CD pipeline hosted on the cloud service, to guarantee that they run without failures.
%    \item All contributors are welcome to participate in code reviews, which may address any issues not captured by testing 
%    (for example, coding style as described in the coding guidelines\footref{foot_code_guidelines}).  
%    \item The code is then merged if all the tests pass and review comments are resolved.
%\end{enumerate}

The ease of collaboration in Microsoft Recommenders is extensible to enteprise-grade development. With examples of best practices covering the entire end-to-end pipeline of a recommender architecture, data scientists, developers, and researchers can seamlessly work out a minimum viable product, and transform it into a production-ready system by scaling up the underlying computing/data storing infrastruture and build pipeline. For instance, the combination of versioning and CI/CD tools on a single node machine can be extended to industry-level production systems like Databricks \footnote{\url{https://databricks.com/}} and Azure DevOps \footnote{\url{https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/services/devops/}} for production use.
