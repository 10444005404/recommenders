\section{Conclusion}

Our main objective in building Microsoft Recommenders has been to make the processes of 
doing research or data science on recommendation systems more productive.
In several projects involving recommendation systems in enterprise settings, we have observed significant productivity gains by using the repository,
which amounted to speeding up the implementation time of a new recommendation 
system by 10 times or more than before.
Furthermore, Microsoft Recommenders addresses one of the most frequent challenges, which is integrating
algorithms into complete end-to-end pipelines for recommendation either in an industrial or 
academic setting.
