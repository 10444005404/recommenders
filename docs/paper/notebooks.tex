\subsection{Recommenders Notebooks}

The second main component of Microsoft Recommenders are the notebooks. They demonstrate examples and best practices, 
written in Jupyter notebooks, for building recommendation systems.
%NOTE: instead of citing the exact names of the folders that can change in the future, I list the high level concepts
There are notebooks for each part of a standard recommendation pipeline. They are
classified in the following categories:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Quick start notebooks:} The quick start notebooks are examples of recommendation algorithms that 
    can be the run in less than 15 minutes. The objective is to quickly introduce some examples and concepts.
    \item \textbf{Deep dive notebooks:} These notebooks contain a more detailed description of a system. In some cases
    we summarize the main mathematical development of an algorithm and show its implementation.
    \item \textbf{General notebooks:} They cover general use cases like data preparation, evaluation, hyperparameter
    tuning or operationalization.
\end{itemize}
