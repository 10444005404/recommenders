\section{Overall Approach and Technologies}

The repository is open-source under the MIT License and contributions that follow the guidelines are encouraged.  
The development follows standard Github practices such as issues, milestones and pull requests.

All the algorithms and utilities have been written in the Python programming language and the demostrations are 
in the form of Jupyter notebooks \cite{jupyter}.

The platforms supported are Linux and Windows, on a local computer, on premises, or on the Azure Cloud \cite{azure}, depending on availability of resources.
Some of the algorithms can take advantage of GPU resources if available and some others require a Spark environment \cite{spark}.
