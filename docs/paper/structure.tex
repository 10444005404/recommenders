\section{Structure of the Repository}

Microsoft-Recommenders is based on best practices for building recommendation systems, which have been learned from application with production-ready systems.
As a consequence, we have followed an {\em end-to-end} approach, which is not limited to just the training of an algorithm, but encompasses the following components, typical in a recommendation pipeline:

\begin{itemize}
\item Data preparation: Preparing and loading data for each recommender algorithm
\item Model: Building models using various classical and deep learning recommender algorithms such as Alternating Least Squares (ALS) or eXtreme Deep Factorization Machines (xDeepFM).
\item Evaluate: Evaluating algorithms with offline metrics
\item Model Select and Optimize: Tuning and optimizing hyperparameters for recommender models
\item Operationalize: Operationalizing models in a production environment on Azure
\end{itemize}

Several utilities are provided in \url{https://github.com/microsoft/recommenders/blob/master/reco_utils} to support common tasks such as loading datasets in the format expected by different algorithms, evaluating model outputs, and splitting training/test data. Implementations of several state-of-the-art algorithms are provided for self-study and customization in one's own applications.
